ENTERPRISE LICENSE:

    Enterprise features are free for non-commercial usage (e.g. personal projects, true open source with no monetization or owned by any company).

    If you are working on a codebase for work, profit, contracting, another company, etc. where you expect that the repository owner (directly or indirectly, e.g. parent company) may be generating revenue/income from said codebase, then you are subject to requiring an enterprise license.

    You may contact Dan Goodman to inquire about an enterprise license.

    This is based on the honor system. We do not require a key or have this code reach out to an API to verify licenses. Be a good person.

    This license is subject to change at any time.
